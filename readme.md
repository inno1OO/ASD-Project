## Problem Statement
After a 40 days of fasting, a group of young Christian decided to create a group of prayer called TryJesus Ministry, our goal is to spread the word of God to the max living being possible. When we started, we were less than 20. Now the community is growing so fast that it becomes mandatory to manage members data dinamically. Now everthing we do, we did them using excel or on paper. We only have an app that help us to manage the tithes and offering. We want to manage members data. For every member, we want to know their name, address, email, phone number, their pair (because every member have a prayer partner). Them members must be able to manage their devotion history, send their devotion, and eventually edit them. The members must receive notification on daily basis to remind them to do their devotion. 
The system must be able to manage the meetings link, we have weekly prayer on zoom, each prayer session is recorded, and we share the recording link so anyone who was not present can watch them anytime. So we need a system to manage these links, the users will be able to search a link by date or by the preach subject. We need to categorize each meeting, because not every meeting have the purpose, we often have formation on specific subject. We have a lot of needs, but we want to address them gradually. As of today, we need to give to evryone the abtility to manage their devotion, like add a new one, update it and delete it in some case. Each member must receive a daily notification to remind them to do it. It will be great if the app give the leader the ability to publish event so everyone can be aware of the upcoming events.
