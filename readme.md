# Problem Statement

After a 40 days of fasting, a group of young Christian decided to create a group of prayer called TryJesus Ministry, our goal is to spread to word of God to the max living being possible. When we start, we were less than 20. Now the community is growing so fast that it becomes mandatory to manage members data automaticaly. Now everthing we do, we did them using excel or word. We only have an app that help us to manage the tithes and offering. We want to manage members data. For every member, we want to know their name, address, email, phone number, their pair (because every member have a prayer partner). Them members must be able to manage their devotion history, send their devotion, and eventually edit them. The members must receive notification on daily basis to remind them to do their devotion.
