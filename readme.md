# Problem Statement

After a 40 days of fasting, a group of young Christian decided to create a group of prayer called TryJesus Ministry, our goal is to spread to word of God to the max living being possible. When we start, we were less than 20. Now the community is growing so fast that it becomes mandatory to manage members data automaticaly. Now everthing we do, we did them using excel or word. We only have an app that ehlp us to manage the tithes and offering.
